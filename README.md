# Homework #5

This was the fifth coding assignment for the Fall 2020 CS1575 (Data Structures) course. The purpose of this code was designed around linked lists (std::list).

# Information From Assignment README
Mimic the **std::list** behavior with your MyList (must use a **doubly linked list**). In addition, you must use exactly ONE (not two) sentinel/dummy node (to which the m_sentinel pointer points), which is linked to the last and first elements of the list at all times. This is different than the DLL example that had been shown in class which used two sentinel nodes (one for the head and one for the tail). Using the sentinel node in this case should still provide you the convenience of simplifying the *insert*, *append*, and *remove* methods by eliminating all need for special-case code when the list is empty, or when inserting at the head or tail of the list.

## Input/Output
Given only indirectly this time.The sample input and output are defined in terms of the behavior of the std::list (which you must fully test yourself).
